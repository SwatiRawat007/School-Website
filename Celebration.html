                        <h2>HOLI</h2>
                        <p class="az">Pichkari ki dhar, gulal ki bauchar, apno ka pyar, yehi hai Holi ka tyohar!
                          Celebrating the colours of childhood since over 20 years, we love to paint the town with all vibrant hues every Holi. Our cute Prideens truly look forward to celebrating the fun-filled festival of Holi at school. They simply love to play with fragrant floral colours along with their peers and warmly greet ‘Happy Holi’ to everyone. They are also educated about the precautionary measures to be taken while playing Holi. It is always the most cherished and colourful festival for all of them!</p>

                          <h2>EARTH DAY</h2>
                          <p class="az">Lush grass, blue skies, fresh air and rippling streams. Let’s create a world of Green dreams! In an endeavour to encourage the students to reflect on what they are doing and what they can do to make our planet more sustainable, Earth Day is celebrated with enthusiasm at Mother’s Pride. The little hands sow seeds to plant saplings and water them to do their bit as environmentally conscious citizens. This celebration not only enhances their socio-emotional and fine motor skills but also creates a generation full of nature lovers!</p>
